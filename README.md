# DL- Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## AIM
To develop a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising application.

## Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS
# STEP 1:
Load MNIST data and add noise to images.

# STEP 2:
Build a convolutional autoencoder.

# STEP 3:
Train the model with noisy images, minimizing MSE loss.

# STEP 4:
Update weights using backpropagation.

# STEP 5:
Test the model and visualize original, noisy, and denoised images.

# STEP 6:
Repeat through multiple epochs for better denoising performance.
